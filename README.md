### I have created a constellation effect of particles moving in a randomized pattern.  The particles respond to mouse interaction by connecting lines to the mouse pointer when the mouse is within a specific radius of them (mouse distance).  They also connect to each other when close enough (star distance).  User can control the behavior with four sliders that allow the increase or decrease of particle count, particle speed, mouse distance, and star distance.
